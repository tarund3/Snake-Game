This is a simple 2D Snake Game built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The game runs directly in the browser and allows players to control the snake with the arrow keys. The goal is to collect food, grow the snake, and avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features

- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- Score is displayed based on the amount of food eaten.

## Technologies Used
